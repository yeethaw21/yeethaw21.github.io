            &body=To the Office of [Senator/Representative],%0D%0AMy name is [y/n] and I am a resident of [city/state]. I am emailing today to call for an end to qualified immunity for public officials. According to Amir Ali and Emily Clark of The Appeal, “under the doctrine of qualified immunity, public officials are held to a much lower standard. They can be held accountable only insofar as they violate rights that are “clearly established” in light of existing case law.”%0D%0AThis level of permissibility has serious consequences, as evidenced by the way Seattle police officers assaulted a Black woman named Malaika Brooks, cuffing and tasing her during a routine traffic stop in 2004. In the aftermath of this event, the officers evaded severe punishment with “qualified immunity” — they could not cite an explicit legal statute that rendered their actions illegal. Since African-Americans — particularly Black cis and trans women — are disproportionately targeted by encounters with the police, they bear the brunt of this law’s  consequences.%0D%0AQualified immunity creates a legal grey area for public officials, including police officers, and allows them to get away with actions that do not explicitly violate a legal statute or constitutional right. This clear lack of boundaries within the law has allowed countless police officers, such as those involved in Brooks’ case, to overstep the boundaries of innocent Black civilians.%0D%0AFrankly, silence — or even the absence of a firm stance — in the face of injustice is aiding the actions of the oppressor. The systemic racism perpetuated by American police and mass incarceration has been enabled by qualified immunity: police officers are able to evade justice for their crimes. Conversely, Black people must live with the trauma imposed upon them by the legal systems that were supposed to protect their rights.%0D%0AI urge you to listen to community leaders and members of [city/state] and support the “End Qualified Immunity Act” that Representative Justin Amash will soon introduce on the House floor, and that Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Ed Markey will similarly sponsor on the Senate floor.%0D%0A%0D%0AThank you,%0D%0A[y/n]`, '_self');
